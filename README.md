# BACKEND LEARNING CHECKLIST
## Hello, myself, yourself
After a long period of work, as a "Software Engineer", as a "Full-stack Developer", working in various position, knowing a bit about each position, this repository is used for learning, exploring, systematizing, and practicing knowledge related to the role of a "Backend Engineer" from basic to expert.
I will complete this checklist along with one of my silly ideas, to avoid it being boring, and who knows, this project might succeed.
